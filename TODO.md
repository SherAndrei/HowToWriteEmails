Good afternoon, dear colleagues.
The subject matter of today talk is how to write
formal letters in english. Email is the main method of business communication. Writing emails is not easy, because we are deprived of the main component of communication - a direct response from the human. Therefore, you need to maintain a formal and respectful tone, write competently and politely.

We'll discuss rules of formal email writing
described by consultantplus, and what various univercities in UK can add to them. Let us begin.

Here are main rules suggested by consultantplus,
we'll cover them all shortly. 

1 Write the subject of the letter.
* Keep the subject straight to the point
* Don't use words that will make both recipient and their mail service think that your letter is spam.

2 Address recipient by name.

* It is polite to address recipient by their name, and it will keep the letter from spam folder
* Greeting -- the only place to use exclamation point in formal letter
* If this is not the first letter of the day, you can address recipient by name, add a comma and continue the letter from the next line and with a small letter

3 Write briefly, straight to the point.

In business correspondence, complex speech structures, and discussions on topics not related to the work process are not welcome. 
In the first lines, formulate the main idea of the letter.
In the following paragraphs, provide arguments and explanations. Clearly formulate questions and requests, and indicate the desired response time.
Also avoid using different fonts and emojis, keep only the main thesis in the letter, everything else can be described in attached file.
If you want to discuss several topics, write several letters. It'll will allow faster searching in the future. 

4 Name the attached files clearly.

Attached files must be named so that it is clear what they are about and who the author is. This will make it more convenient for all participants in the correspondence.
Itâ€™s also better to name your mailbox for business correspondence clearly and neutrally, using your last name and full name in the name. Mailbox provided by the university is the great example.

5 Sign the letter.

The correct thing is to write your first and last name. Depending on the situation, you can add status or position. If you are already working, ask your colleagues if it is required at your company to indicate any other information, for example, phone number.

6 Reread the letter before sending.
* Reread the text, correct typos and errors.
* Check that intended files are attached.
* Send the letter in work time. Mail notification can wake up the recipient. 

That is all for consultantplus, let's discuss how united kingdom univercities suggest how to write formal letters.

We'll start with Leeds Beckett University's A Simple Guide to Email Communication Guidelines and Protocols.

* E-mail is not always the best form of communication.
* Make the title relevant.
* Do not ignore basic English.
* Keep it short.
* Be careful about replying to all.

As you can see several suggestions are overlapping, we'll cover new ones.

* E-mail is not always the best form of communication.

1. Before sending an e-mail, consider whether it is the best way to communicate. Maybe a face-to-face conversation or a telephone call may be better.
2. Do not discuss urgent issues via e-mail as they often tend to be lost.
3. Don't say anything you wouldn't say in person.

* Do not ignore basic English. Be careful about replying to all.
1. Do not completely ignore the basic use of grammar and spelling. Remember the importance of punctuation and grammar for the reader.
2. Do not rush with the answer, wait until you have time to respond properly.
3. Only send to those to whom the message is relevant.

As for univeristy of Bolton the main concern in email writing is safety, confidentiality and privacy. For example,
here is the intersting quote from their policy and guidance
article.
That means that anyone can ask for private email conversations with another person. Therefore they have added distinguishing suggestions. Here are some that i have found intersting.

There is nothing particularly intersting about e-mail creation, replying and forwarding, in e-mail guidance of University of Liverpool, but there are important notes about how you need to treat attachments.

Main point is Be very careful when opening attachments even if the message appears to be from someone you know. E-mail attachments infected with viruses are one of the most widely used methods for infecting PCs.

Be selective in the sending of attachments, use shared drives instead.

Consider the file format of the attachment. When sending an attachment you should ensure, in advance, that the recipient can handle your attachment - because, not all computer users use the same software.

Be careful about the size of an attachment. Large files can clutter the recipient's mailbox.

That's all for liverpool. In guidance from Sussex university i have not managed to find somthing that differs and catch an eye. The first bullet in their guide: think before you send an email. Is it the best way to communicate? It might be better discussed face to face or delivered as a presentation.

Let's continue. Last but not least, Wall Street English blog gives examples of the formal email format in English. Let's look at them.
